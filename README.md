# Module 4 Challenge: JavaScript Quiz

## Description
The goal of this project was to create an app for a user to take a quiz with questions based on some pieces of JavaScript knowledge. This wias accomplished through use of web APIs such as timer intervals and local storage. While developing this app I was able to learn how to incorporate useful web APIs in my scripts.
